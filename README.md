## Usage

The provided Python scripts demonstrate various aspects of FMCW radar signal processing. These scripts can be run using a Python interpreter or a Jupyter Notebook. The code includes examples of:

- Generating FMCW signals
- Calculating range and velocity
- Visualizing frequency sweeps, range-Doppler maps, and more.

## Examples

- **Frequency Sweep** Visualization: Explore how the transmitted and received signals change over time in an FMCW system.

- **Range-Doppler Map**: Generate and visualize a range-Doppler map, which provides a two-dimensional representation of targets' range and velocity.

- **Signal Processing**: Examine the steps involved in processing FMCW radar signals, including range calculation and Doppler frequency shifts.
